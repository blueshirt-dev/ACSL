# Kanban Board Guidelines

## Post Its

These are the heart of the Kanban board since each post it represents a task, a collection of tasks, a goal, or a project. For best results though, keep whatever is written on the post it simple enough that if there's updates or notes you want to make that they can be included on the relevant post it. Past that please follow the format of whoever is working on the post it in the upper left hand corner, leave blank for no one, date in the upper right hand corner, a line underneath and then write the idea and relevant info on the rest of the note. 

## Ideas

This is where tasks that may or may not actually happen are to be placed. It can be anything from neat software, hardware, programming language, server setup, network architecture, or anything else that someone wants to try. 

## Planning

This is where a task that will be worked on will go. It's for things that Wyatt has agreed need to happen or at least need to be tried for improving the lab. 

## In Progress

This is where post its that are actively being worked on by one or more people go. 

## Review

Notes that are here are waiting for Wyatt to look at and okay them for complete, or for showing off what has been accomplished to others at a workshop session on the cool thing that was completed. 

## Complete

These are notes that have been worked and deemed done. Since it looks good to have a lot of notes in the complete section do not remove a note once added. Only when a row is more than half filled with complete notes go to the next row and pull them off, stacking right to left for keeping completion order, and add them to the archived notes.

## Archived

These are the completed tasks and projects that have aged out of the complete section on the kanban board. We keep them around as a show piece and to showcase how far we've come and what has been done.
