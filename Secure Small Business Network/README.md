# Secure Small Business Network

Our goal is to build a model small business network that offers better security that what most are using, at an affordable price point and with good usability. Then, make it available to the community so that better security is easily obtainable. This is largely done by leveraging open source projects and adding in the missing bits.

The key elements of the Secure Small Business Network are:


- Secure Core with modularity baked into the design
- Aligned with elements of the [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.29.ipd.pdf) 
- PFSense based firewall, standardizing on Netgate hardware
- Preconfigured VLANs, etc.
- Open Canary integration
- 2FA integration with Yubikey
- Password Management via Bitwarden or Keypass
- Linux Desktop suggested using PopOS!
- Backup strategy built on Duplicati
- Included policy templates
