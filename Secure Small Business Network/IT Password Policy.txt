IT Password Policy V.1.0

Updated 10 September 2023

Written by Wyatt Johnson

This policy is informed by NIST Special Publication 800-63B 

## Business Level Information

Consider these suggestions for helping to improve your businesses password security:
- Whenever possible, use a password manager. (Keypass and Bitwarden are two examples.) This allows you to easily keep a different password for every website and system, without having to try and remember them all.
    
- Block or educate employees to not use passwords contained in password dictionaries.
- Lock accounts after multiple invalid login attempts.
- Disallow context-specific words as passwords, such as the company’s name.
- Regularly check employee passwords against breached password lists.
- Reauthenticate user when there is any period of inactivity of 15 minutes or longer.
- Disable the employee’s account immediately upon employment termination.
- Disable accounts when employee is on leave and only enable when employee can authenticate proper dates of return.
- Restrict configuration by implementing least privilege. This means employees will only have access to what they need to complete their responsibility.
Conducting least privilege audits regularly, making sure that each account does not have more privilege than needed.
- Implement your preferred form of two factor authentication and enforce users to comply to help secure company assets. 


# Background

Passwords are the common, basic layer of security when working with computer equipment. This is often how you “prove” to a computer that you are the actual person that is associated with a username. The industry has updated its understanding of what makes a “good password” in recent years to better accommodate how people think and current cybersecurity threats.

## Objective

The goal of this policy is to clearly define the rules that this company has regarding passwords. 


## Scope

This policy applies to all employees of this company and has guidelines for both the business and individual employees. 

## Policy
- Passwords should be no shorter than 12 characters long. These longer passwords are much harder for computers to “guess”. 
- Passwords should be as random as possible. We want passwords that have a high level of entropy, as these are also harder for computers to “guess”.
- Whenever possible, use a password manager. (Keypass and Bitwarden are two examples.) This allows you to easily keep a different password for every website and system, without having to try and remember them all.
- Two factor authentication should be used whenever possible. This is a bit more work when logging in, but makes it much harder for other people to pretend to be you. 
- Avoid using repetitive or incremental passwords. The more random a password is, the more secure it becomes.
- Do not use password hints when given the option. This can just end up creating a “back door” for hackers to use.
- Only change your password when necessary. It is better to pick a really good password and stick with it than pick a simpler one and change it frequently.
